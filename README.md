sane-git-hooks
==============

A sane git hook directory structure, so you can drop in many hooks for the same event and make them project-dependent.

just run ./deploy_hooks.sh your_git_project_dir to deploy into your project

Add scripts to the some-hook-dir directories in whatever scripted language you want.
